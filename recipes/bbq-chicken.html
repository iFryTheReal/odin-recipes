    <p class="intro"><em>This Baked BBQ Chicken recipe is easy to make in the oven with homemade or store bought BBQ
            Sauce! It pairs with
            so many sides for an easy dinner idea!</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 chicken drumsticks, (about 1 ¾ lbs.)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt/Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>357.5 g barbecue sauce, see notes for homemade recipe</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Dry Brine</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This step is optional, but makes a big difference in the flavor and texture of the chicken. Pat the chicken
            completely dry and sprinkle with salt on all sides. Line a baking sheet with 2 cooling racks and place the
            chicken on top. Refrigerate uncovered for 2 to 20 hours, the longer the better. This will make it juicy on
            the inside, crispy on the outside, and will season it inside and out.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken completely dry. Season all sides with salt (if you haven’t already), along with pepper and
            paprika. Brush skin-side-up with olive oil. Flip, then brush with more oil.</li>
        <li>Bake skin-side-down on a rimmed, light colored baking sheet for 26 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and wipe away excess oil/drippings. Baste with BBQ sauce (I use a “dabbing”
            motion which helps me apply more sauce.) Flip the chicken so it’s skin-side-up. Baste with more BBQ sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken and baste the tops with BBQ sauce a second time. Bake for 8 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove and baste with BBQ sauce for a third time. Bake for 8 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Optional: Broil at 425°F for a few minutes to crisp up the skin a little more. Watch it carefully during
            this time.</li>
        <li>Remove and let rest for 5-10 minutes prior to serving. See blog post for pairing suggestions.</li>
    </ol>
